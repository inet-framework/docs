Installing INET
===============

.. note::

   Prerequisite: Download and install OMNeT++ from http://omnetpp.org.


Automatic Installation
----------------------

Recent versions of the OMNeT++ IDE can download and install INET (the
latest stable version) for you.

How does it work?

#. Open the OMNeT++ IDE (``omnetpp``)
#. Go to the workbench (dismiss the Welcome screen). The first time you
   do this, a prompt will ask if you want to install INET.
#. Keep the boxes checked and proceed.

If you skipped this step (opened the workbench but skipped installing
INET), nothing is lost:

#. Go to *Help -> Install Simulation Models*.
#. A dialog will appear with the available simulation models. Currently
   only INET is listed there, simply select it and follow the prompts.

Both ways, the IDE will download, unzip, and automatically build INET
from the sources.


Manual Installation
-------------------

You'll need manual installation if you downloaded an INET version other
than the latest stable one, or you have cloned the INET git repository
to the local filesystem. The only "tricky" part is how to import the
project into the workspace.

#. Download the INET sources
#. Unpack it into the directory of your choice:
   ``tar xvfz inet-<version>.tgz``
#. Start the OMNeT++ IDE, and import the project via *File -> Import ->
   Existing Projects to the Workspace*. A project named ``INET`` should
   appear.
#. Build with *Project -> Build*, or hit Ctrl+B
#. Now you should be able to launch example simulations.

Please also read the ``INSTALLATION`` file in the INET sources, as it
may contain additional information.
