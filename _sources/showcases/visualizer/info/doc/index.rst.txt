Visualizing Submodule Information
=================================

Goals
-----

Complex models such as protocols are often implemented as compound
modules sometimes several levels deep. Submodules deep down in the
module tree often contain information that is essential to understand
model behavior. In the graphical runtime environment, one has to enter
the compound modules or drill down in the object inspector to access
this kind of information.

This showcase demonstrates how state information of important submodules
can be visualized at containing network nodes, at the top level of the
network. This visualization makes such information conveniently
available at a glance, without the need to go deep into compound
modules. This showcase contains a configuration that demonstrates
visualization of IEEE MAC 802.11 contention states during the channel
access procedure.

About the visualizer
--------------------

The ``InfoVisualizer`` module (included in the network as part of
``IntegratedVisualizer``) can visualize information provided by various
submodules deep down in the module hierarchy. This information is
visualized at the submodule of the contaning network node, typically at
the top level canvas. The following image illustrates this with the
example of the UDP submodule:

.. figure:: example.png
   :width: 100%

The image on the left shows the state information displayed by the UDP
app. To see this, one has to go into the containing node. The image on
the right shows the same information displayed by ``InfoVisualizer``
above the containing node, on the top level canvas.

The submodules whose states should be visualized can be selected with
the visualizer's ``modules`` parameter. This parameter takes full path
module names. Wildcards can be used to select a certain submodule in
multiple nodes. Additionally, one can specify multiple submodules for a
node. By default, the value of the ``modules`` parameter is ``""`` (no
information displayed.) Also, the visualization can be turned on and off
with the ``displayInfos`` parameter, which is ``true`` by default.

The visualizer can display module information in various ways, selected
with the ``format`` parameter. This takes a format string, which can
contain the following directives:

-  %n: module full name
-  %p: module full path
-  %d: display string text - the 't' tag of the submodule's display
   string
-  %i: the return value of the module's info() function
-  %s: the return value of the module's str() function

The default format string is ``"%s"``.

On the example image above, the display string text is visualized,
selected with the ``"%d"`` directive.

The visualization
-----------------

In the example simulation, three wireless nodes will communicate via
wifi. We will visualize the contention state of their MAC modules. The
simulation can be run by choosing the
``VisualizingSubmoduleInformation`` configuration from the ini file. The
network for the simulation is the following:

.. figure:: infonetwork.png
   :width: 100%

It contains three ``AdhocHosts`` arranged in a simple chain. It also
contains an ``Ipv4NetworkConfigurator``, an
``Ieee80211ScalarRadioMedium``, and an ``IntegratedVisualizer`` module.
The communication ranges of hosts is determined by their radio
transmitter power, which is configured so that hosts can only reach
adjacent hosts in the chain. Hosts' routing tables are set up
accordingly, thus packets going between ``source`` and ``destination``
are routed via ``relay``.

The visualization is enabled by setting the ``modules`` parameter. The
visualizer is configured to visualize IEEE 802.11 MAC contention state
during the channel access procedure. This information is contained in
each node's Contention module. The location of the Contention module is
``somehost.wlan[*].mac.dcf.channelAccess.contention``:

.. code-block:: none

   *.visualizer.*.infoVisualizer.modules = "*.*.wlan[0].mac.dcf.channelAccess.contention"

The ``format`` parameter is set to display the submodule's display
string text:

.. code-block:: none

   *.visualizer.*.infoVisualizer.format = "%d"

Additionally, ``source`` is configured to send UDP packets to
``destination``.

When the simulation is run, the contention state is displayed above the
nodes:

.. figure:: accessstate.png
   :width: 100%

The visualization automatically reflects the changes in the contention
state. It takes on the following values:

-  IDLE when the node doesn't want to transmit
-  DEFER when the node wants to transmit but the channel is busy
-  IFS+BKOFF when the node is backing off while the channel is idle

The following video illustrates as a packet from ``source`` makes its
way to ``destination``:

.. video:: VisualizingSubmoduleInformation0.mp4
   :width: 718
   :height: 480

   <!--internal video recording playback speed 0.43 animation speed none-->

.. todo::

   what is happening on the animation

When ``source`` starts transmitting the UDP packet, its contention state
is IDLE. The contention state of ``relay`` is also IDLE while receiving
``source``'s tranmission. When ``relay`` receives the packet, its
contention state changes to IFS+BACKOFF for the duration of the backoff
period. Then its contention state switches to DEFER as it sends an ACK
frame to ``source``, because the UDP packet is waiting in the queue to
be relayed to ``destination``. When it finishes sending the ACK, the
contention state changes to IDLE as it transmits the UDP packet to
``destination``. When it receives the packet, it sends an ACK to
``relay``.

Then it starts relaying the packet to ``destination``, and its
contention state swithces to DEFER, because an ACK

.. todo::

   <!--
   When `source` starts transmitting the UDP packet, its state
   changes to OWNING. The relay host's state is IDLE while receiving this
   packet. After it has received it, the state changes to IFS+BKOFF, then,
   while transmitting the ACK, it changes to DEFER. Meanwhile, the state of
   the source host remains OWNING, because it has the channel for the
   duration of the PACKET-ACK exchange. The relay host's state is DEFER
   because it wants to send the packet it just received to the destination
   host. After the ACK, the relay host has the channel. The state of the
   destination host remains IDLE, as it doesnt want to send any packets.

   The source host transmits an UDP packet to relay host, which ACKs it.
   While this happens, the state of the source hosts OWNING, as it owns the
   channel for the duration of the packet-ACK exchange. When the relay host
   receives the UDP packet, its state changes to IFS+BKOFF. It then
   transmits the ACK, while its state turns to DEFER, because it already
   has the packet it wants to relay to the destination host. After the ACK,
   the relay host gets the channel. The state of the destination host
   remains IDLE, as it doesn't transmit any packets, just ACKs the ones it
   receives.
   -->

Multiple submodules can be specified with the visualizer's ``modules``
parameter. For example, the UDP application's state can be displayed in
addition to the channel access state:

.. code-block:: none

   *.visualizer.*.infoVisualizer.modules = "*.*.wlan[0].mac.ctn[0] *.*.udpApp[0]"

This would look like the following:

.. figure:: multiplemodules2.png
   :width: 100%

Here, the visualizer displays the UDP application's number of sent and
received packets, in addition to the contention state.
