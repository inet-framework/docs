Visualizing Network Nodes
=========================

Goals
-----

In network simulations, it is essential to visualize the participants of
the communication. Customizing the appearance of nodes may also be
important, for example, to highlight nodes or to distinguish nodes based
on location or function.

This showcase demonstrates how network nodes are visualized how their
appearance can be customized in INET simulations.

INET version: ``3.6``

Source files location: `inet/showcases/visualizer/networknode <https://github.com/inet-framework/inet-showcases/tree/master/visualizer/networknode>`__

About the Visualizer
--------------------

In INET simulations, ``NetworkNodeVisualizer`` module (included in the
network as part of ``IntegratedVisualizer``) is responsible for
visualizing network nodes. ``NetworkNodeVisualizer`` includes two
submodules: ``NetworkNodeCanvasVisualizer`` and
``NetworkNodeOsgVisualizer``.

All nodes can be visualized on a 2D canvas by the
``NetworkNodeCanvasVisualizer`` module and on a 3D scene by the
``NetworkNodeOsgVisualizer`` module. We can narrow the list of nodes to
be displayed by using the ``nodeFilter`` parameter. The name of the node
is displayed by default, but it can be hidden by setting the
``displayModuleName`` parameter to ``false``.

Visualization on a 2D canvas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``NetworkNodeCanvasVisualizer`` is responsible for displaying nodes on a
2D canvas. On the 2D canvas, each node is represented by an icon. The
icon of the node can be customized by setting the display string of the
node in the network description file (NED). The display string can be
set by tags. The icon can be customized by specifying the ``i`` display
string tag. It has three arguments:

-  The first argument specifies the icon to be used. This argument is
   used to find the image, just like the OMNeT++ image path or the
   ``cIconFigure`` class.
-  The second argument specifies the color of the icon. It accepts
   English color names (more precisely, SVG color names) and HTML-style
   RGB values.
-  The third argument defines the amount of colorization in percent. If
   the parameter value is 100, it means full colorization.

We can set the size of the icon by using the ``is`` display string tag.
The size can be ``vs`` (very small), ``s`` (small), ``n`` (normal),
``l`` (large) and ``vl`` (very large).

.. note::

   All supported display string tags are listed in the `OMNeT++ Simulation
   Manual <https://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/manual/#cha:display-strings>`__.)

Visualization on a 3D scene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``NetworkNodeOsgVisualizer`` is responsible for displaying nodes on a 3D
scene. (In this version of INET,
``IntegratedVisualizer.osgVisualizerType = "IntegratedOsgVisualizer"``
must be set for visualizing nodes in 3D.) OMNeT++'s 3D visualization
is based on the open-source ``OpenSceneGraph`` (osg) and ``osgEarth``
libraries. These libraries offer high-level functionality, such as the
ability of using 3D model files directly, accessing and rendering online
map and satellite imagery data sources, and so on. In this showcase, we
deal only with 3D models and we do not deal with maps. You can learn
about maps in the `Visualizing Terrain and Urban
Environment <https://inet.omnetpp.org/inet-showcases//visualizer/earth/>`__
showcase.

By default, each node is represented by a 2D icon on the 3D osg scene
which is set in the display string of the node. If we want to replace
the 2D icon, we need to load external resources, for example, images or
3D models. The resource we want to load is specified in the ``osgModel``
parameter. By default, the ``OMNeT++`` image path is used to find the
image.

.. note::

   Here are some supported file formats: - geometric file
   formats: 3dc, 3ds, flt, geo, iv, ive, lwo, md2, obj, osg, osgb, - image
   file formats: bmp, gif, jpeg, rgb, tga, tif.

There is support for so-called "pseudo loaders" in osg, which provide
additional options for loading 3D models. Pseudo loaders are able to
perform some basic operations on the 3D model, after it is loaded. To
use pseudo loaders, append the parameters for the modifier followed by
the name of it to the end of the file name upon loading the model. The
pseudo loaders are able to use in any order and they are separated by
dots.

-  The ``scale`` pseudo loader can multiply the size of the model by a
   certain value. If decimal fraction is used, it must be written in
   parentheses, e.g ``(0.8).scale``.
-  The ``trans`` pseudo loader can translate the model by a certain
   value along the X, Y and Z axes. The values are separated by commas.
   The format of the ``trans`` pseudo loader is ``X,Y,Z.trans``.
-  The ``rot`` pseudo loader can rotate the model by a certain degree
   around the X, Y and Z axes. The format of the ``rot`` pseudo loader
   is ``X,Y,Z.rot``.

Examine the following example.

.. code-block:: none

   *.exampleNode.osgModel = "example.osg.2.scale.0,0,10.trans.180,0,90.rot"

-  ``example.osg`` is the file name of the external 3D model that
   represents the ``exampleNode`` network node,
-  ``2.scale`` scales ``example.osg`` to 200%,
-  ``0,0,10.trans`` translates ``example.osg`` 10 units upwards,
-  ``180,0,90.rot`` rotates ``example.osg`` 180 degrees around the X
   axis and 90 degrees around the Z axis,
-  The parts of the parameter string are separated by dots.

The color of the model also can be changed by using the
``osgModelColor`` parameter. This parameter accepts English color names
(more precisely, SVG color names) and HTML-style RGB values.


.. note::

   Further information about ``OpenSceneGraph`` can be found on
   the `OpenSceneGraph web site <http://www.openscenegraph.org>`__ and in
   dedicated `OpenSceneGraph
   books <http://www.openscenegraph.org/index.php/documentation/books>`__.

Customizing Appearance of Network Nodes
---------------------------------------

This example demonstrates how the nodes' look can be customized. A
simulation is created for this example, it can be run by selecting the
``VisualizingNodes`` configuration from the ini file.

The network contains two ``AdhocHost`` nodes, ``pedestrian`` and
``car``. The default icon of nodes is changed by modifying their display
string in the ``NetworkNodeVisualizerShowcase.ned`` file. (The default
icon also can be modified in the node's *Properties* on the *Appearance*
tab.)

.. code-block:: none

   car: AdhocHost {
     @display("p=168,117;i=misc/car2");
   }
   pedestrian: AdhocHost {
     @display("p=113,156;i=misc/person3");
   }

.. figure:: IconsOnCanvas_v0111.png
   :width: 100%

On the 2D canvas, a car and a man appears, representing the nodes. The
``p`` display string tag defines the position of the nodes. On the 2D
canvas, the (0,0) position is in the upper left corner of the
playground.

.. figure:: IconsOnOsgscene_v0111.png
   :width: 100%

By default, the icons on the 3D scene are the same as on the 2D canvas.
The icons are automatically rotating towards the camera. The playground
axes are also displayed.

In our next experiment, we replace the icon of the nodes with external
3D models. The models will be scaled in order to be proportionate to
each other.

.. code-block:: none

   *.pedestrian.osgModel = "boxman.osgb.(0.3).scale" *.car.osgModel = "car.osgb.50.scale"

The ``boxman.osgb`` and the ``car.osgb`` files are loaded and scaled.
This configuration affects only 3D models. The following animation shows
how the nodes look like after we have replaced their icon with 3D
models.

.. video:: ModelsLoaded.mp4
   :width: 698

The ``pedestrian`` node is represented by an animated walking boxman and
the ``car`` node is represented by a car model instead of 2D icons.

The orientation of network nodes is updated by their own mobility
submodule. It is possible that orientation of the 3D model does not
match with the orientation of the node, i.e. the ``pedestrian`` 3D model
is moving sideways.



.. video:: PedestrianMovesSideways.mp4
   :width: 698

The orientation of the 3D model can be initialized by the ``rot`` pseudo
loader. If the node is a mobile node then the mobility submodule of the
node will manage future rotations of the node during the simulation. To
achieve the correct orientation, the ``pedestrian`` 3D model should be
rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise around the Z axis.

.. code-block:: none

   *.pedestrian.osgModel = "boxman.osgb.(0.3).scale.0,0,90.rot"

.. video:: NodesOrientationIsRight.mp4
   :width: 698

The above animation shows that both 3D model's orientation is correct.
They are initialized by pseudo loaders and updated by the mobility model
of the network node.
