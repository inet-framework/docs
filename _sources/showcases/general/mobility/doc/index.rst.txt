Concepts
--------



.. <!-- What are moblity models? -->

In general, mobility models describe motion in a 3D right-handed
Euclidean coordinate system. More precisely, they describe how position
and orientation (and also their derivatives: velocity/acceleration,
angular velocity/acceleration) changes over time. Mobility models are
abstract models in the sense that they are not concerned with how the
motion is actually used (e.g. desribe the motion of a wireless network
node).



.. <!-- How does one interpret position, orientation, etc.? -->

Coordinates are in X, Y, Z order measured in metres. Conceptually, the X
axis goes to the right, the Y axis goes forward, the Z axis goes upward.
The 2D canvas in Qtenv displays the scene looking towards positive Z by
default, so the X axis goes to the right and the Y axis goes downward.
Orientations are represented by 3D Tait-Bryan (Euler) angles measured in
radians. The angles are in Z, Y', X" order that is often called
intrinsic rotations.

.. todo::

   illustrate the coordinate system

.. todo::

   there's a projection involved between the 3D and the 2D coordinate
   systems, the projection is the Z axis by default, can be overridden with
   the scene visualizer

The ``SceneCanvasVisualizer`` module allows configuring a different 2D
projection using angle, scaling and translation parameters. For more
information, see `Visualizing the Physical
Environment </showcases/visualizater/environment>`__



.. <!-- How are mobility models implemented in INET?-->

In INET, mobility models are usually implemented as OMNeT++ simple
modules. There are several mobility modules, implementing various
mobility models. Some only determine initial position, some describe a
motion over time, some allows combining other mobility models to create
complex motions. The available mobility modules can be found in the
``inet/src/inet/mobility`` directory.



.. <!-- How are moblity models used? -->

But of course, modeling motion in itself is not very useful, so the
motion pretty much always has a subject. For example, mobility models
are used to describe the motion of wireless network nodes. In wireless
networks, the signal strength depends on the position and orientation of
transmitting and receiving nodes, which in turn determines the success
of packet reception. In order to simulate this, the ``WirelessHost``
module contains a mobility submodule which describes its motion.

In contrast, wired network nodes generally don't have mobility
submodules, because they are stationary and the position of wired
network nodes have no effect on communication.

   too much "wired network nodes"

.. todo::

   explain use cases for human motion, vehicle motion, antenna offset
   and orientation, etc.

.. <!-- How are mobility modules connected to their subject modules? -->

There's an optional bidirectional mapping between the motion described
by the mobility module and the position of its subject module on the 2D
canvas in Qtenv. The bidirectional mapping is realized through reading
from and writing to the **display string p tag** of the subject module.



.. <!-- What is the display string p-tag and how does it work? -->

Submodules, such as network nodes, have optional "p" tags in their
display strings in the NED file, which tell the graphical runtime
environment where to draw the icons representing the modules on the
canvas (and also in the IDE). Display string p-tags are two-dimensional
(X and Y), and their purpose is to contol where to draw the submodule
icons. For example, a ``StandardHost`` with p tag set to the coordinates
(93,167):

.. <p><pre class="include" src="MobilityShowcase.ned" from="host1" upto="display"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../MobilityShowcase.ned
   :start-at: host1
   :end-at: display

Position is three-dimensional and is a state of mobility modules.
Position is used in the calculations of wireless communications, for
example. For example, the position of a host (the host's mobility
submodule selected in the inspector panel):

.. figure:: position_inspector.png
   :width: 100%

Position is always relevant, even if the simulation is run without a
GUI, whereas the display string is not. (not always)



.. <!-- How is the bidirectional mapping realized? -->

The two directions of the bidirectional mapping can be toggled
independently, with parameters.

In one direction, mobility modules can read the display string p tag of
a subject module, and initialize the position based on the coordinates
in the display string p tag. This mapping helps positioning using the
IDE, where you can drag submodules. The mapping is done only once, at
initialization, and works even if there is no GUI. The mapping is
controlled by the ``initFromDisplayString`` parameter, where applicable.

In the other direction, mobility modules can continuously update the
display string p tag of the subject module, according to the current
position. This mapping helps understanding motion in the runtime GUI,
where submodules move around on the parent compound module's canvas. The
mapping is controlled by the ``updateDisplayString`` paramater. The
mapping is only relevant when the simulation is run with a GUI.



.. <!-- The behavior is controlled by the `initFromDisplayString`, where applicable (certain mobilities have it, others dont because its not compatible with the model, such as in the case of CircleMobility, where the position must be on the circle) -->



.. <!-- There's an optional bidirectional mapping between the motion described by the mobility module and the position of its subject module on the 2D canvas in Qtenv.

.. <!-- TODO: -initFromDisplayString: this mapping helps positioning using the IDE, you can drag submodules, p tag, etc.
   Firstly, mobility modules can read the display string p tag of a subject module, and initialize the position based on the coordinates in the display string p tag. This action is done only once, at initialization, and works even if there is no GUI. The behavior is controlled by the `initFromDisplayString`, where applicable (certain mobilities have it, others dont because its not compatible with the model, such as in the case of CircleMobility, where the position must be on the circle)

The above effects pertain to the subject module of the mobility.

.. <!-- - it is done through the display string p tag
   - the two directions can be toggled independently
   - the initFromDisplayString reads from the p tag for initial pos (one time, at initialization)(not GUI only)

   - the subjectModule selects the subject -> the above two pertains to that -->

   -updateDisplayString: this mapping helps understaning motion in the runtime GUI, submodules move around in the parent compound module's canvas -->

TODO: copy stuff from old version



.. <!-- How can mobility modules get positions? -->

Without mobility, the position of nodes is not interpreted (in fact
doesn't exist), and not relevant. In this case, if the nodes have a
display string p tag, they are drawn in the GUI and IDE according to
that. If they don't have a p tag, the GUI places them with the layouter
algorithm (this can lead to different layouts when re-layout is
selected).



.. <!--how do nodes get positions when they have mobility?-->

When nodes have mobility, the situation is a bit more complex. They can
either get their initial position from the display string p tag, or from
the mobility module.

Some mobility modules have the ``initFromDisplayString`` and
``initialX``, ``initialY``, and ``initialZ`` parameters for initial
positioning. When a module has a p tag set, and the
``initFromDisplayString`` parameter is set to ``true`` in its mobility
module, the position will be initialized from the p tag. Otherwise, when
there is no p tag set or ``initFromDisplayString`` is ``false``, the
position will be set according the ``initialX``, ``initialY``, and
``initialZ`` parameters. The default for these three parameters is a
random value inside the constraint area.

Other mobility modules (e.g. those that describe completely
deterministic trajectory) initialize position with other parameters. For
example, the ``CircleMobility`` module (describing circular motion) has
parameters to define the center and the radius of the circle, and also
the starting angle. The starting angle parameter is what does the
initial positioning, along the circle defined by the other parameters.

Generic Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All mobility modules in INET extend ``MobilityBase``. It has some
generic parameters, which are thus common to all mobility modules, such
as the following:

-  The **constraint area**, as the name suggests, limits movement to an
   area (more precisely, volume) of definite size. By default, the
   constraint area is infinite (i.e. unconstrained). The constraint area
   is defined by six parameters, setting the two boundaries of the area
   per coordinate axis. The parameters are the following:
-  ``constraintAreaMinX``
-  ``constraintAreaMaxX``
-  ``constraintAreaMinY``
-  ``constraintAreaMaxY``
-  ``constraintAreaMinZ``
-  ``constraintAreaMaxZ``
-  ``displayStringTextFormat``: Contains directives as to what to
   display above mobility submodules in the GUI. For example, displaying
   position and velocity can be achieved with ``"p: %p\nv: %v"`` format
   string: |image0|
-  ``visualRepresentation``: Selects which module is moved by this
   mobility module (parent module by default), more on this in a later
   section.

Visualizing state of mobility modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



.. <!-- What does the mobility visualizer do? -->

The ``MobilityVisualizer`` module can display certain states of mobility
modules:

-  **Position** as a colored dot (useful when the mobility doesn't have
   a subject module, i.e. doesn't move anything; ``displayPositions``
   parameter)
-  **Orientation** as a semi-transparent cone, representing angular
   position (``displayOrientations`` parameter)
-  **Velocity** as an arrow, representing the velocity vector
   (``displayVelocities`` parameter)
-  **Movement trail** as a fading path (``displayMovementTrails``
   parameter)

The ``displayMobility`` parameter is the master switch, toggling the
display of the above features.

Simplistic examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section demonstrates the above concepts in a very simple way. It
contains two example simulations. The example simulations illustrate
that mobility modules are abstract models, and the effects of the
``visualRepresentation`` parameter of ``MobilityBase``. The example
simulations are defined in ``Simplistic1`` and ``Simplistic2``
configurations in omnetpp.ini.

In the **first example**, there are just two mobility modules in the
network, which will move themselves. The mobility modules are of the
type ``LinearMobility``. The ``LinearMobility`` module describes motion
along a straight line. Here is the NED definition of the network:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="MobilityShowcase.ned" from="MobilityShowcaseSimplistic1" until="MobilityShowcaseSimplistic2"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../MobilityShowcase.ned
   :start-at: MobilityShowcaseSimplistic1
   :end-before: MobilityShowcaseSimplistic2

Here is the configuration in omnetpp.ini:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="Simplistic1]" until="Simplistic2"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: Simplistic1]
   :end-before: Simplistic2

The configuration sets the speed to 10 m/s and the constraint area of
the two mobility modules to 400x400 meters (matching the playground).
The display string text format is set to display the position, velocity
and orientation. The ``visualRepresentation`` parameter is set to
``"."`` (itself), so mobility modules move themselves. Here is a video
of the simulation:



   .. video:: Simplest1.mp4



.. <!--internal video recording, zoom 1.3, playback speed 4.37, animation speed 1-->



.. <!-- TODO: they start at the same angle beause of the default, and they bounce back from the side -->

The two modules move around inside the constraint area (which currently
matches the playground), bouncing back from the boundaries.

In the **second simple example**, there are two mobility modules, which
are set to not move anything. They will just keep track of position and
orientation, which can be visualized with ``MobilityVisualizer``. The
configuration extends the previous one, but uses the
``MobilityShowcaseSimplistic2`` network:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="MobilityShowcase.ned" from="MobilityShowcaseSimplistic2" until="MobilityShowcaseE"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../MobilityShowcase.ned
   :start-at: MobilityShowcaseSimplistic2
   :end-before: MobilityShowcaseE

It contains two ``LinearMobility`` modules, and an
``IntegratedVisualizer`` module. The configuration in omnetpp.ini is the
following:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="Simplistic2" upto="moduleFilter"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: Simplistic2
   :end-at: moduleFilter

And here are the relevant keys from the ``General`` configuration:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="displayMobility" upto="displayMovementTrails"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: displayMobility
   :end-at: displayMovementTrails

In addition to the keys defined in the ``Simplistic1``, the visual
representation is turned off in both mobility modules, so they won't
move anything. In the ``MobilityVisualizer`` submodule of
``IntegratedVisualizer``, all visualization features are is turned on,
and the ``moduleFilter`` is set to ``**.mobility*`` from the default of
``**.mobility``, because the modules are named ``mobility1`` and
``mobility2``. (It is needed because generally hosts contain one
mobility module named ``mobility``, but not in this case. The default
module filter wouldn't match ``mobility1`` and ``mobility2``.)

Here is the simulation when running:



   .. video:: Simplest2.mp4



.. <!--internal video recording, zoom 1.3, playback speed 4.37, animation speed 1-->

.. <!-- TODO: actually, the constraint area is defined in the general config...so as the visualization. maybe this example shouldnt be here? -> nope...the constraint area keys are not the same DELETE THIS
   but later -->

.. <!-- TODO: now the mobility doesn't move anything, but it keeps track of the position. The mobility visualizer can visualize the position...
   and the orientation and the velicity and the movement trail. this is useful for what? also, how is the initial positioning here ? -->

.. <!-- TODO: visualizeMobility ? -->

Categorizing mobility models
----------------------------



.. <!-- there are some which describe orientation. some do both. The groups and dimensions. -->

.. <!-- TODO: the concepts of mobility...a mobility module describes a motion...keeps track of a position and orientation state...it can move a visual representation of a node (can be nothing, itself, another node) -->

Users are likely to have ideas about different kinds of motion, and
mental models of what motions should be simulated.

There are all kinds of motions that can be modeled. This section takes a
look at them, and gives examples of how they can be simulated in inet,
which mobility modules implement them, and how to combine mobility
modules to create complex motion.

The models can be grouped along several dimensions. The following
sections describe such dimensions and their categories, illustrating
mobility models in each category with mobility modules and example
simulations. Of course, a mobility module can belong to multiple
categories. The dimensions along which we categorize mobility models in
this showcase are the following:

-  **Type of movement**
-  **Scope of the model**
-  **State changed by the model**
-  **Method of configuration**
-  **Time scope**/**Initial vs. overtime positioning**
-  **Model Complexity**
-  **Trace-based vs. calculated / time of calculation**

Note that this showcase describes the featured mobility modules and
their important parameters. For all parameters, check the NED
documentation of the different mobility modules
(```inet/src/inet/mobility`` <https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/tree/master/src/inet/mobility>`__).

.. <!-- TODO: somewhere -> mobilitybase -->

The configuration / about the simulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the example simulations, the mobility modules are submodules of
network nodes, as this is the most prevalent use case. The simulations
use one of two networks, ``MobilityShowcaseA`` and
``MobilityShowcaseB``. In both of them, the size of the playground is
400x400 meters. Both of them contain ``StandardHost``\ s.
``MobilityShowcaseA``, defined in
:download:`MobilityShowcase.ned <../MobilityShowcase.ned>`, looks like
the following:

.. figure:: staticnetwork2.png
   :width: 100%

The network contains seven ``StandardHost``\ s (``host1`` to ``host7``),
laid out on the playground using display string tags ("p" tags), like as
follows:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="MobilityShowcase.ned" from="MobilityShowcaseA" upto="}"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../MobilityShowcase.ned
   :start-at: MobilityShowcaseA
   :end-at: }

In the ``MobilityShowcaseB`` network, the number of ``StandardHost``\ s
can be set with the ``numHosts`` parameter from the ini file. Also,
there is no display string "p" tag:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="MobilityShowcase.ned" from="MobilityShowcaseB" upto="}"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../MobilityShowcase.ned
   :start-at: MobilityShowcaseB
   :end-at: }

Here is what the network looks like in the IDE:

.. figure:: bnetwork.png
   :width: 100%

Both networks also contain an ``IntegratedVisualizer`` module to
visualize some aspects of mobility. No other modules are needed (i.e.
Ipv4NetworkConfigurator or radio medium) to demonstrate the mobility
models. There won't be any communication, just movement.



.. <!-- TODO to keep it simple...no communication will take place -->

The ``General`` configuration in
:download:`omnetpp.ini <../omnetpp.ini>` contains some configuration
keys common to all example simulations:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="General" until="Simplistic1" comment="#"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: General
   :end-before: Simplistic1

By default, hosts look for the configurator module in the top level of
the network, under the name ``configurator``. Since the network doesn't
need and doesn't have a configurator, the configurator module path in
all hosts is set to an empty string to prevent error messages.

All visualization features of ``MobilityVisualizer`` are turned on, and
the constraint areas of all mobility modules are set to match the size
of the playground. (All nodes will move in the XY plane, so the Z
coordinate is 0 everywhere.)

.. <!-- TODO: from the perspective of a network node moved by mobility models -->

.. <!-- TODO: the common parts...general config, the two networks -->

.. <!-- TODO: the list of dimensions -->

Categorizing mobility models according to **type of movement**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mobility models are now grouped according to the nature of movement they
describe. From this aspect, there are three categories of mobility
models:

-  **Static position**\
-  **Deterministic movement**\
-  **Stochastic movement**\

.. <!-- TODO: the definition should be not here? -->

The example simulations for these categories use the
``MobilityShowcaseA`` network.

\ **Static position**
'''''''''''''''''''''

In this category, the position set by mobility models is constant, i.e.
the nodes are stationary. These kinds of mobility models are useful for
e.g. initial positioning of network nodes. Examples include
``StationaryMobility``, ``StaticLinearMobility``,
``StaticConcentricMobility``.

.. <!-- <pre>
   They just set the positions, and they are constant. Static movement -> constant position

.. the main feature here is that they dont move...
   </pre> -->

The example simulation for this category is the ``StaticPosition``
configuration, using the ``StationaryMobility`` model. The
``StationaryMobility`` model only sets position. It has ``initialX``,
``initialY``, ``initialZ`` and ``initFromDisplayString`` parameters. By
default, the ``initFromDisplayString`` parameter is ``true``, and the
initial coordinate parameters select a random value inside the
constraint area. Additionally, there are parameters to set the initial
heading, elevation and bank (i.e. orientation in 3D), all zero by
default. It also has parameters for positioning in a geographical
coordinate system (undefined by default), but that is out of scope for
this showcase. Note that ``StationaryMobility`` is the default mobility
model in ``WirelessHost`` and derivatives.

The configuration for the example simulation in omnetpp.ini is the
following:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="StationaryMobility" upto="false"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: StationaryMobility
   :end-at: false

The configuration just sets the mobility type, and turns off orientation
visualization. Here is what it looks like when the simulation is run:

.. <!-- Which is the default in `WirelessHost`. It just sets the positions. -->

|image1|

As the nodes are stationary and nothing happens, there is no need for a
video :)

\ **Deterministic movement**
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In this category, the mobility models describe movement
deterministically, in the sense that the mobility model doesn't use
randomness when calculating the trajectory (the parametrization can
contain random values, however). Examples of such mobility modules
include ``LinearMobility``, ``CircleMobility``, ``RectangleMobility``.

The example simulation for this category is the ``DeterministicMotion``
configuration, which uses the ``LinearMobility`` module.

The ``LinearMobility`` module describes a linear trajectory. It has
parameters for speed, acceleration and starting angle. After the initial
setting, the angle only changes when the node bounces back from the
boundary of the constraint area. The model also has parameters for
initial positioning : - ``initialX``, ``initialY``, ``initialZ``: random
value inside the constraint area by default (effective when not
initialized from display string) - ``initFromDisplayString``: true by
default

There are additional parameters. By default, the ``speed`` and
``acceleration`` parameters are zero. The angle parameter sets the
initial orientation, it is a random value by default.

The ``LinearMobility`` model is a derivative of ``MovingMobilityBase``,
which has the ``faceForward`` parameter. When this parameter is ``true``
(the default), orientation matches the velocity vector. When it's
``false``, the orientation is (0,0,0).

.. <!-- TODO: the defaults for the other parameters -->

The configuration in omnetpp.ini is the following:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="LinearMobility" upto="speed"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: LinearMobility
   :end-at: speed

It leaves most parameters on default, but sets the mobility type and the
speed (the speed is 0 by default).



   .. video:: Deterministic2.mp4

\ **Stochastic movement**
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

Mobility models in this category contain random elements when describing
the movement (although in a sense the movement is deterministic, as the
random number generators are deterministic.) Example mobility modules
include ``GaussMarkovMobility``, ``MassMobility``, ``ChiangMobility``,
``RandomWayPointMobility``.

The example simulation for this category is the ``StochasticMotion``
configuration, which uses the ``GaussMarkovMobility`` module.

V1

``GaussMarkovMobility`` uses a Gauss-Markov model to contol randomness
in the movement. It has an ``alpha`` parameter, which can run from 0
(totally random motion) to 1 (deterministic linear motion), with the
default of 0.5. There is also a ``speed`` parameter with no default, and
an ``angle`` parameter with random angle by default. TODO: what does
variance do ?

.. <!-- `GaussMarkovMobility` uses a Gauss-Markov model to control the randomness in the movement. -->

V2

``GaussMarkovMobility`` uses a Gauss-Markov model to contol randomness
in the movement. The mobility starts with a mean direction. At constant
intervals, a new direction is chosen based on the mean direction, the
direction in the previous time interval, and a gaussian random variable.
The alpha parameter controls how much the random variable affects the
direction. It has an ``alpha`` parameter, which can run from 0 (totally
random motion) to 1 (deterministic linear motion), with the default of
0.5. The random variable has a mean of 0, and its variance can be set by
the ``variance`` parameter. There is also a ``speed`` parameter with no
default, and an ``angle`` parameter with random angle by default. The
``margin`` parameter adds a margin to the boundaries of the constraint
area, so that the mobility bounces back before reaching it.

.. <!-- TODO: the showcase doesnt describe all parameters, for that, check the ned documentation. -->

Here is the configuration in omnetpp.ini:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="GaussMarkovMobility" upto="alpha"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: GaussMarkovMobility
   :end-at: alpha

The mobility module is set to totally random motion, with a variance of
0.5.



   .. video:: Stochastic2.mp4



.. <!--internal video recording, animation speed 1, playback speed 4.37, zoom 1.3, normal run, about 100s simulation time-->

Categorizing mobility models according to their **scope**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mobility models can be grouped according to their scope, i.e. they
either affect a ``single`` module, or a ``group`` of modules.

Mobility models can be grouped according to their scope: - **single**:
they describe the motion of a single module, independent of the motion
of other modules. - **group**: they describe the motion of a group of
modules, e.g. a flock of birds flying in formation.

.. <!-- More precisely, when multiple modules are affected, each module contains its own mobility submodule. The mobility submodules are of the same type, and all mobility submodules work together to position/move the modules. -->

More precisely, when a module describes the motion of multiple modules,
each module contains an instance of the same mobility module type. The
mobility submodules in the group work together to describe the group's
motion.

The mobility modules demonstrated so far were from the ``single``
category. Examples from the ``group`` category include
``StatisGridMobility`` and ``StaticConcentricMobility``.

\ **Group mobility**
''''''''''''''''''''

The example simulation for this category is defined in the ``Group``
configuration in omnetpp.ini. It uses the ``StaticGridMobility`` module.

``StaticGridMobility`` positions all nodes in a rectangular grid. It has
parameters for setting the properties of the grid, such as a margin, the
number of row and columns, and the separation between rows and columns.
By default grid has the same aspect ratio as the available space
(constraint area by default). The ``numHosts`` parameter must be set in
all mobility modules of the group.

The simulation uses the ``MobilityShowcaseB`` network. The configuration
in omnetpp.ini is the following:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="Group" upto="mobility.numHosts"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: Group
   :end-at: mobility.numHosts

We specify the ``numHosts`` parameter, the other parameters of the
mobility are left on their defaults. Thus the layout conforms to the
available space:

   :width: 100%

.. figure:: group2.png
   :width: 100%

.. <!-- <pre>
   changing position and derivatives
   changing orientation and derivatives
   both
   </pre> -->

Categorizing mobility modules according to the **state** they affect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtually all mobility models affect the whole state of mobility
(position, orientation and derivatives), even if they set some of them
to zero, for example. Mobility models are categorized according to which
state of motion they **focus** on:

.. <!-- Mobility models are now categorized according to what mobility state they affect. The categories are the following: -->

-  ``Position`` and derivatives: focusing on position, velocity and
   acceleration
-  ``Orientation`` and derivatives: focusing on orientation (heading,
   elevation, bank), angular velocity/acceleration
-  ``Both`` of the above

Some modules only focus on position, such as ``StaticGridMobility``.
Most mobility modules focus on both position and orientation. The
examples so far fell into the ``Position`` and ``Both`` category. What
follows is an example from the ``Orientation`` category. Please rewrite
this.

\ **Orientation**
'''''''''''''''''

Mobility models in this category only focus on orientation. The example
simulation features the only such module, ``FacingMobility``.

``FacingMobility`` sets the orientation of the mobility module to face
towards another mobility module. More precisely, the orientation is set
to point from a source mobility module to a target mobility module. Both
can be selected by the ``sourceMobility`` and ``targetMobility``
parameters. By default, the source mobility is the mobility module
itself (``sourceMobility = default(".")``). The target mobility
parameter has no default. ``FacingMobility`` also has the inital
positioning parameters ``initialX``, ``initialY``, ``initialZ``, and
``initFromDisplayString``.

For example, one can set in ``host3`` the source mobility to ``host1``'s
mobility module, the target mobility to ``host2``'s mobility module. So
the orientation of ``host3`` points in the direction of the
``host1``-``host2`` vector:

.. figure:: facingexample.png
   :width: 100%

Note that this screenshot is not from the example simulation for this
category, it's just for illustration.



.. <!-- On to the example simulation... -->

The example simulation demonstrating ``FacingMobility`` uses the
``MobilityShowcaseA`` network. The nodes which are in a circle around
the central node are configured to face towards the central node. The
central node itself is configured to move around using
``LinearMobility``. The example simulation is defined in the
``Orientation`` configuration in omnetpp.ini:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="Config Orientation" until="Scriptable"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini

   :end-before: Scriptable

Note that the value for the ``sourceMobility`` and ``targetMobility``
parameters is a path to a mobility module (relative to the current
mobility module). So the mobility of ``host1`` to ``host6`` is
configured to face towards ``host7``'s mobility submodule.

Categorizing mobility models according to **method of configuration**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mobility models can be grouped according to how they are configured:

-  **ini parameter driven**
-  **Scriptable**

In the ini parameter driven category, the mobility module's behavior can
be controlled with parameters from the ini file. The category included
all mobility modules demonstrated so far. The motion in mobility modules
in the scriptable category can be controlled with various XML scripts,
depending on the actual mobility module. In general, scripting allows
for more flexible configuration.

\ **Scriptable mobility models**
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Mobility modules in this category include ``TurtleMobility`` and
``BonnMotionMobility``. The example simulation uses the
``TurtleMobility`` module.

Movement in ``TurtleMobility`` is controlled by an XML script. The
script contains elements and attributes, which describe the motion, such
as setting coordinates, turning by some angle, going a certain distance,
etc. These motion elements can be used as building blocks for descibing
complex motion. Motion elements can be repeated as well. See the example
below. For the complete description of the XML language, see the `NED
documentation of
``TurtleMobility`` <https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/blob/master/src/inet/mobility/single/TurtleMobility.ned>`__.
The mobility model's only ini parameter is ``turtleScript``, which
specifies the XML file to use.

The XML script used in the example simulation describes a node moving
along a perfect hexagon. The motion is described as such: start at X
with a speed of V. Go 100 meters, then turn 60 degrees. Repeat the last
two. The simulation uses the ``MobilityShowcaseB`` network, with one
host. Here is the configuration in omnetpp.ini:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="Scriptable" upto="turtleScript"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: Scriptable
   :end-at: turtleScript

And here is the XML config file:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="config.xml"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../config.xml

The script describes the hexagon motion pattern:

-  the ``set`` element sets the initial position and speed
-  the code in the repeat element is repeated for each side of the
   hexagon:
-  go ``forward`` 100 meters
-  ``turn`` 60 degrees
-  (repeat this 12 times, so the node does two laps)

It looks like the following when the simulation is run:



   <p>

   </p>



.. <!--internal video recording, animation speed 1, playback speed 5.5, zoom 1.3-->

Note that the flexibility of ``TurtleMobility`` allows for implementing
the functionality of some of the other mobility models with a turtle
script. There are some examples of this in the ```TurtleMobility`` NED
documentation <https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/blob/master/src/inet/mobility/single/TurtleMobility.ned>`__.

Categorizing mobility models according to their **complexity**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two categories of mobility models: - **simple** - **compound**

The models described so far belonged in the simple category. Compund
mobilities use multiple mobility modules to describe a motion. There are
two examples, ``AttachedMobility`` and ``SuperpositioningMobility``.
Both are demonstrated below.

\ **Compound** mobilities
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

``AttachedMobility`` can "attach" itself to another mobility module,
with a certain offset. I.e. the ``AttachedMobility`` module takes the
mobility state of the mobility module it is attached to, and applies and
optional offset to the position and orientation. It keeps its mobility
state up-to-date. Position and orientation, and their derivatives are
all affected by the mobility where the ``AttachedMobility`` is attached.

.. todo::

   the coordinate systems, the constraint area, etc.

The ``mobilityModule`` parameter selects the mobility module to attach
to (the parameter has no default, so it must be set). There are also per
coordinate offset parameters for position and orientation:

-  ``offsetX``, ``offsetY``, ``offsetZ``
-  ``offsetHeading``, ``offsetElevation``, ``offsetBank``

**``AttachedMobility``**: Example 1
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In the first example, ``host[0]`` is moving using ``LinearMobility``.
Three more hosts are attached to it using ``AttachedMobility`` at
different offsets. The simulation uses the ``MobilityShowcaseB`` network
with four hosts. The simulation is defined in ``Attached1`` in
omnetpp.ini:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="Attached1" upto="offsetHeading"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: Attached1
   :end-at: offsetHeading

``host[0]`` starts at the center of the playground, and moves using
``LinearMobility``. The other three hosts have ``AttachedMobility``, and
are attached to ``host[0]``'s mobility module. The offset is interpreted
in the coordinate system of ``host[0]``'s mobility module. The
coordinate system rotates and translates as ``host[0]`` moves.
``host[1]`` is offset 50m along the X axis, ``host[2]`` 50m along the Y
axis, ``host[3]`` -50m along the Y axis. Also, ``host[3]``'s heading is
offset 45 degrees.

Here is a video of the simulation running:



   .. video:: Attached2_2.mp4

The hosts keep a formation around ``host[0]``. Note that as ``host[0]``
bounces back from the boundary of the constraint area, there is a jump
in the position of the other hosts.



.. <!-- In the second example, there will be circular motion. -->



.. <!-- The nodes move circularly, but keep the offset from the source node. They move circularly as the coordinate system of the source node rotates. -->

**``AttachedMobility``**: Example 2
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In the second example simulation, one of the hosts will be moving along
a circle, with other hosts "attached". The example simulation uses the
``MobilityShowcaseB`` network, with five hosts. The simulation is
defined in the ``Attached2`` configuration in omnetpp.ini:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="Attached2" upto="offsetHeading = -180deg"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: Attached2
   :end-at: offsetHeading

``host[0]`` will move along a circle, orbiting around the center of the
playground. The other hosts will use ``AttachedMobility``, and will be
attached to ``host[0]`` with various offsets, summarized on the
following image:

.. <!-- TODO: more details -->

.. figure:: circular.png
   :width: 100%

.. <!-- TODO: host x is set to orbit on the opposite side from host 0 -> radius of the circle and the heading -->

The attached hosts will keep the offset from ``host[0]``, and they'll
move circularly as the coordinate system of ``host[0]`` rotates.



   .. video:: Attached3.mp4

The relative position of the hosts is constant. ``host[4]`` is
configured to orbit on the opposite side of the circle. It appears as if
host[4] is orbiting on the same circle, and in the same direction, but
actually it is just offset in ``host[0]``'s coordinate system by the
circle radius and -180 degrees.

**``SuperpositioningMobility``**
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

``SuperpositioningMobility`` combines the effect of multiple mobility
models. It is a compound module containing other mobility modules. The
number and type of mobility modules is configurable.

``SuperpositioningMobility`` combines the trajectory of multiple
mobility modules. It is a compound module, which contains other
mobilities as submodules. The mobility state (position, orientation and
their derivatives) of ``SuperpositioningMobility`` is the sum of the
states of the contained submodules. It allows to create complex motion
with several simple mobilities, and to separate initial and over time
positioning.

The ``numElements`` parameter defines the number of mobility submodules,
which are in a submodule vector named ``element``.
``SuperpositioningMobility`` also disables the visual representation of
the mobility submodules by default, and does the representation itself
according to the sum of the others. Rewrite.

The elements can be accessed/referenced from the ini file as if they
were ordinary mobility submodules in a host, but they are one level
deeper. So instead of ``mobility.typeName = XY``, the mobility
submodules can be referenced with ``mobility.element[0].typeName = XY``

**``SuperpositioningMobility``**: Example 1
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

.. todo::

   <!-- In the first example simulation, a single host will be moving in a circle, with some randomness applied. -->

In the first example simulation, ``host[0]`` will move in a circle using
``CircleMobility``. Some random movement will be applied on the circular
motion, using ``GaussMarkovMobility``. The simulation uses the
``MobilityShowcaseB`` network with one host. The simulation is defined
in the ``Superpositioning1`` configuration in omnetpp.ini:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="Superpositioning1" upto="constraintAreaMaxZ"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: Superpositioning1
   :end-at: constraintAreaMaxZ

So ``host[0]`` uses ``SuperpositioningMobility``. The mobility is
configured to have two submodules: element[0] is a ``CircleMobility``

``host[0]`` will move in a circle using ``CircleMobility``. Some random
movement will be applied on the circular motion, using
``GaussMarkovMobility``.

The circlemobility in host0 is configured to have two submodules, a
circlemobility and a gauss markov mobility. The two mobility submodules
are set up similarly as in the previous examples that featured them. The
constraint area TODO

.. todo::

   it combines attached and superpositioning

In the second example simulation, a host will move in a hexagonal
pattern (indentically to the previous example simulation featuring
``TurtleMobility``). Another host will orbit around the first host as it
moves. The first host, ``host[0]`` uses ``TurtleMobility``, the host's
trajectory and turtle script is indentical to the previous example
simulation featuring ``TurtleMobility``. The other host, ``host[1]``,
uses ``SuperpositioningMobility``, with the superposition of an
``AttachedMobility`` and a ``CircleMobility``. The simulation uses the
``MobilityShowcaseB`` network with two hosts. Here is the configuration
in omnetpp.ini:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="Superpositioning2" upto="-50mps"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: Superpositioning2
   :end-at: -50mps



.. <!-- TODO how it is attached. why the constraint area needed. The network, 2 hosts... -->

The mobility of ``host[1]`` is attached to ``host[0]``'s mobility,
without an offset. The ``CircleMobility`` in ``host[1]`` is configured
to circle around 0,0 with a radius of 50m. The constraint area of the
``CircleMobility`` module is interpreted in the coordinate system of the
mobility module it is attached to. By default, it is limited between 0
and 400m as defined in the ``General`` configuration. Position 0,0 in
this coordinate system is at the position of ``host[0]``'s mobility. So
when ``host[1]`` starts to orbit around 0,0 (``host[0]``), the
``CircleMobility``'s coordinates would become negative, and the host
would bounce back. Thus the constraint area of the ``CircleMobility``
module need to be set to allow negative values for the X and Y
coordinates.

Categorizing mobility models according to **time of positioning**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

According to the time of positioning, mobility models can be grouped
into two categories:

-  **initial positioning**: only concerned with initial positioning
-  **over-time positioning**: concerned with position over time, i.e.
   movement

This classification is meaningful in the context of the superposition of
different mobility models. The idea is that in a complex,
superpositioned motion, some models are responsible for the position of
nodes relative to each other, while other models are reposinsible for
the movement of the nodes. The sum effect can be nodes moving while
keeping a formation (e.g. a flock of birds or formation of airplanes).

The two categories are illustrated with one example simulation, where
mobilities responsible for initial positioning and those for over-time
positioning is superimposed. (superpositioned?).

The example simulation uses the ``MobilityShowcaseB`` network, with
eight hosts. The example simulation uses ``SuperpositioningMobility`` to
combine the effects of multiple mobility modules. The scenario is that
one of the hosts is stationary at the center of the playground. The
other seven hosts are laid out in circle with one of them at the center.
This group of hosts move in a circle around the host at the center,
while facing towards it.

-  the center host uses ``StationaryMobility``
-  the other hosts have a ``SuperpositioningMobility`` module, with
   three mobility submodules
-  one of them is ``StaticConcentricMobility``...

Here is the configuration in omnetpp.ini:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="InitialVsOvertimePositioning" upto="targetMobility"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: InitialVsOvertimePositioning
   :end-at: targetMobility

V2

Here is the configuration in omnetpp.ini:

``host[7]`` stays at the center of the playground, using
``StationaryMobility``:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="InitialVsOvertimePositioning" upto="initialZ"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: InitialVsOvertimePositioning
   :end-at: initialZ

The other hosts have a ``SuperpositioningMobility`` module, with three
elements. Initial positioning is done by ``element[0]``, a
``StaticConcentricMobility`` module:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="static concentric circles" upto="distance" comment="#"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: static concentric circles
   :end-at: distance

The other hosts will move around ``host[7]`` in a circle. This is
achieved by ``element[1]`` in ``host[0]``, which is a
``CircleMobility``:

.. todo::

   why is the center of the circle not 200,200 ?



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="larger circle following" upto="speed" comment="#"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: larger circle following
   :end-at: speed

The other hosts (``host[1]`` to ``host[6]``) have an
``AttachedMobility`` submodule as ``element[1]``.

.. todo::

   why no other settings are needed. that, from the perspective of
   only attached mobility, they are at the same position, but later will be
   superponed with the initial circle positioning



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="other hosts follow" upto="mobilityModule" comment="#"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: other hosts follow
   :end-at: mobilityModule

Also, all moving hosts face towards ``host[7]`` with ``FacingMobility``:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="towards the last host" upto="targetMobility" comment="#"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: towards the last host
   :end-at: targetMobility

The example simulation also aims to illustrate that
``SuperpositioningMobility`` and ``AttachedMobility`` can be combined to
create very complex motion patterns.

.. <!-- ### The mars rover example -> using the mobility to orient antennas -->

Using mobility to orient antennas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mobility modules can be used to orient antennas independently from the
orientation of their containing network node. This section describes
just that, and demonstrates it with an example simulation.



.. <!-- TODO: actually, the receiver and transmitter submodule uses the antenna's position and orientation -->



.. <!-- antennas can have mobility submodules (so own position and orientation)
   it is useful for orienting antennas independently of the network node -->



.. <!--how can antennas themselves be oriented, without changing the orientation of the network node itself?-->

By default, radio modules contain antenna submodules, whose position is
taken into account when simulating wireless signal transmission and
reception. In network nodes (more specifically, in those that extend
``LinkLayerNodeBase``), the antenna module uses the containing network
node's mobility submodule to describe the antenna's position and
orientation. Thus, by default, the position and orientation of the
antenna (where the signal reception and transmission takes place) is the
same as the position and orientation of the containing network node.
However, antenna modules have optional mobility submodules. The
antenna's mobility submodule allows the network node to have antennas
whose position and orientation is different from those of the network
node.

Thus antennas can be oriented independently of the network node's
orientation. The antennas' position can also be independent of the
containing network node's position, but in many cases, it makes more
sense to attach the antenna position to the network nodes' at some
offset. This allows for creating nodes that are extended objects (as
opposed to being point objects)(they are by default point objects)



.. <!-- Orienting antennas might not make sense when they lack directionality, but in this example, yes. TODO.

.. Antenna orientation might be irrelevant when the antenna lacks directionality, but -->

Note that antenna orientation is only relevant with directional
antennas. This example uses isotropic antennas (and there is no
communication), because the goal is to just demonstrate how antennas can
be oriented independently.



.. <!-- Thus it is more realistic, because antennas can be oriented independently of the network node's orientation. They can be elsewhere. This only makes sense when the antenna position somehow depends on the network node's position, e.g. it is attached. This implies a kind of extended body for the network node. I.e. the network node has a position XY, and the antennas are offset from that.

.. Antenna modules have optinal mobility submodule. In LinkLayerNodeBase, the mobility submodule of the contained antenna module is set to be the network node's mobility module. The antenna module can have its own mobility submodule. Thus its own position and orientation. Thus antennas can be oriented independently of the containing network node's orientation, and can be also positioned independently. The latter makes sense if it is somehow attached to the network node. -->



.. <!-- TODO: antenna orientation doesn't make sense with isotropic antennas. -->



.. <!-- Which leads to there should be directional antennas. Which leads to there should be communication, the success of which depends on the properly oriented antennas. Which leads to the idea that this example is kind of an outlier, and might belong in another (but connected) showcase.

.. OR

.. this example is just a simple version of this other showcase, which contains directional antennas and communication as well.

.. OR

.. this example should be here, and use isotropic antennas...and it should be noted that this whole thing doesn't make sense with isotropic antennas which is kind of dumb -->



.. <!-- - the scenario -->



.. <!-- The scenario is the following: a mars rover prototype is being tested in the desert. It has two antennas, each of them oriented differently. -->

The scenario for the example simulation is the following: a Mars rover
prototype is being tested in the desert. The rover moves in a straight
line, and has two antennas. It uses them to communicate with a base, and
a nearby circling drone. Each antenna is oriented independently. One of
the antennas tracks the drone, the other one is directed at the base.

The simulation is defined in the ``AntennaOrientation`` configuration.
It uses the ``MobilityShowcaseC`` network:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="MobilityShowcase.ned" from="MobilityShowcaseC" until="until"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../MobilityShowcase.ned
   :start-at: MobilityShowcaseC
   :end-before: until

The size of the network is 800x800 meters. The network contains an
``Ieee80211ScalarRadioMedium`` and an ``IntegratedMultiVisualizer``
module. The ``rover``, ``base`` and ``drone`` are ``StandardHost``\ s.



.. <!-- <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="AntennaOrientation8" upto="yellow"></pre></p> -->



.. <!-- TODO: this is too long - the antenna mobility settings only? -->

The ``rover`` is configured to use ``LinearMobility`` to move on the
playground. The ``drone`` uses ``CircleMobility`` to circle around the
center of the playground. The ``rover`` has two wireless interfaces, and
thus two antennas, which have a mobility submodule. The configuration in
omnetpp.ini related to antenna mobility is the following:



.. <p><pre class="include" src="omnetpp.ini" from="antenna.mobility" upto="initFromDisplayString"></pre></p>

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: antenna.mobility
   :end-at: initFromDisplayString



.. <!--this include should work after ini cleanup-->



.. <!-- TODO: about the mobility configuration -->

Each antenna needs to be attached to the network node, and also face
towards its target. Thus each antenna has a ``SuperpositioningMobility``
submodule. Element[0] of the array is an ``AttachedMobility``, and the
antenna's position is attached to and offset from the position of the
host. Element[1] is a ``FacingMobility``, the antenna tracks its target.

.. todo::

   IF IT IS ATTACHED, AND THE ROVER DOESN'T MOVE FORWARD, what
   happens to the facing ? does it need face forward = false ? -> meaning
   it doesnt move in the 0,0,0 direction



.. <!-- the antennas have superpositioning mobility -> attached, and facing
   they are attached at an offset

   most of the time, whether and object is extended or point-like is not relevant. this is not relevant.

   actually, the offset is like 45m...this is ridiculous -> but it is more visible that way. -->
