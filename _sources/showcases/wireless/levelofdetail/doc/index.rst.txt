Level of Detail Example
=======================

Goals
-----

INET can model radio transmissions with various levels of detail. The
radio models range from simpler ones that simulate the transmission of
individual packets, to more complex and realistic ones which simulate
modulation symbols.

This showcase describes the different levels of detail in which INET can
simulate radio transmissions. It also demonstrates a hypothetical
layered radio, which can simulate transmissions at multiple levels of
detail. These are 'packet', 'bit' and 'symbol' level. The example
simulation for this showcase is a parameter study that examines packet
loss as a function of distance when using various modulations and levels
of detail.

INET version: ``3.6``

The model
---------

Layered radio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The model uses ``ApskScalarRadio`` with ``ApskLayeredTransmitter`` and
``ApskLayeredReceiver``. The latter two implements the layered radio
features. When operating in 'packet' domain, the error model computes
packet errors, bits are not computed. In 'bit' domain, the error model
computes erroneous bits. In the 'symbol' domain, the encoding and
decoding of symbols are simulated, the error model computes erroneous
symbols. Simulations with different levels of detail are expected to
produce similar curves.

-  Packet level: transmissions are simulated as individual packets. The
   error model computes bit errors from the
   signal-to-noise-and-interference-ratio (SNIR)
-  Bit level: the individual bits of transmissions are simulated. The
   error model computes which bits get corrupted from the SNIR
-  Symbol level: the encoding and decoding of individual symbols of
   transmissions are simulated. The error model computes which symbols
   get corrupted. The error model can calculate which bits get
   corrupted. The calculation is not an estimation, but the corrupted
   bits can actually be simulated.

When using packet and bit level simulation, even though forward error
correction is not simulated, the error model accounts for its effects on
the bit error rate.

Calculating error rates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``ApskLayeredReceiver`` module uses the ``ApskLayeredErrorModel`` by
default. The error model calculates packet error rate (PER), bit error
rate (BER) and symbol error rate (SER), depending on the level of detail
used. The error rates are calculated from the SNIR, the transmission's
modulation, bandwidth, and bitrate.

In case of packet level modeling, the error model computes which packets
get corrupted. When bit precise modeling is used, the error model
calculates erroneous bits, from which the receiver mechanism can decide
which packets are corrupt. When symbol level precision is used, the
error model computes which symbols get corrupted. The error model
replaces a corrupted symbol with another one, which differs from the
originally transmitted symbol in just 1 bit. The symbol is then decoded
by the receiver, which decides which bits and in turn which packets, are
corrupt.

The error model compensates for the use of forward error correction when
calculating PER, in case of packet level of detail. If bit or symbol
precision is used, the FEC encoding and decoding mechanism is applied to
the bits.

Note that since the radio is modular, the default error model can be
replaced.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two hosts, and one of them pings the other one once every
second. Each simulation runs for 100 seconds, thus 100 pings are sent.
There are four axes in the parameter study:

-  **Distance** runs from 210m to 710m in steps of 5m
-  **Level of detail** for the transmissions are 'packet', 'bit' and
   'symbol'
-  **Forward error correction** (FEC) is either ``ConvolutionalCoder``
   or not using forward error correction
-  **Modulations** used are 'BPSK', 'QPSK', 'QAM-16' and 'QAM-64'

We record the ping loss rate for all runs.

Forward error correction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The used convolutional code has a code rate R = 1 / 2, memory m = 1, and
generator matrix G(D) = (1 1+D). To keep the net bitrate constant across
all simulations, the gross bitrate is increased two-fold when using
forward error correction (36 Mbps instead of 18 Mbps).

Packet loss vs. distance is displayed on the following plots, for each
modulation and forward error correction use case. Each plot contains
three curves pertaining to the three levels of detail. The three detail
levels produce similar curves for the same modulation and forward error
correction, except for two cases (more on these exceptions below.) Click
on the images to zoom:

BPSK
~~~~

QPSK
~~~~

.. image:: qpsk-nofec2.png

.. image:: qpsk-fec2.png


QAM-16
~~~~~~

.. image:: qam16-fec2.png

QAM-64
~~~~~~

.. image:: qam64-nofec2.png
.. image:: qam64-fec2.png

The two exceptions are QAM-16 and QAM-64 with forward error correction
(they are indicated above with a red border.) QAM-16 and QAM-64 has 4
and 6 bits/symbol. When simulating with symbol detail level, the error
model computes which symbols get corrupted. Erroneous bits result from
the decoding of corrupted symbols. Since bits get corrupted in chunks
represented by a symbol, the distribution of bit errors is not
independent. Also, currently the error model "corrupts" just 1
bit/symbol, when simulating with symbol level precision. These effects
lead to the gap between the curves. (The gap is present with the QPSK
modulation, but it is not as prominent, since QPSK only has 2
bits/symbol.)

   So actually, when using qam that has lots of bits per symbol, the bits would get corrupted in chunks,
   represented by symbols. The bit errors are not independent, so...the conclusion is what?
   bit error will be worse? the error model cant compute accuratelly?
   actually, the bit error rate will be lower because the forward error correction mitigates this effect
   for an extent, and it is just lower because the packet and bit levels computed by the error model
   are higher, because they cant be computed as accurately?
   The fact that bit errors are not independent results in what?

   <!--
   Correction
   in the case of symbol level, the bit errors are the result of the decoding of the symbol level transmission.

   From the SNIR, modulation, bandwidth, and bitrate, the BER, PER, and SER is calculated.
   The error model selects which packets will be corrupted with the PER
   The error model selects which bits will be corrupted with the BER
   The error model selects which symbols will be corrupted with the SER, but
   it only corrupts 1 bit (selects a symbol that is 1 bit away from the transmitted)
   This is not very realistic, because more than one bit might get corrupted.
   That is one reason why the curve is shifted to the right (or just to the right of the others. maybe
   the others are shifted to the left because maybe they dont compute the error accuratelly.)
   The other reason is that the bit errors are not distributed independently.

   On the bit level, the FEC is simulated. So as on the symbol level. On the packet level, the error
   model just takes the FEC into account and corrects the bit error rate.

   something like this:

   packet:
   packet -> SNIR -> packet error rate -> effect of FEC -> corrupted packets

   bit:
   packet -> bits -> FEC -> SNIR -> gross corrupted bits -> unFEC -> net corrupted bits -> corrupted packets

   symbol:
   packet -> bits -> FEC -> symbol coding -> SNIR -> corrupted symbols -> symbol decoding -> unFEC -> corrupted bits -> corrupted packets
   -->

The following images show all modulations on the symbol detail level:

.. image:: noFEC2.png
.. image:: FEC2.png

Generally, the more complex modulations have less range. Also, it is
apparent from the plots that forward error correction can extend the
range of transmissions to some extent. When just a few bits get
corrupted, the forward error correction can correct those, and the
transmission is correctly receivable.

TODO: the steepness of the curves

The following image contains all modulations and forward error
correction use cases on one plot:
