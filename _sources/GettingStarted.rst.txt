Getting Started
===============

Here are some things you can do after having installed INET
successfully.

Try Some Example Simulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find the ``inet`` project in the IDE workspace, and explore it. Sources
of protocol implementations and other components are in the ``src/``
folder. The ``examples/`` folder contains several example simulation
models, that is, networks assembled from components under ``src/``.

You can launch an example simulation by selecting its folder, and
clicking *Run* on the toolbar. The simulation will execute as a GUI
application, letting you explore, run, pause, and single-step the
simulation model. Simulation results will be placed into the
``results/`` subfolder; you can view them by double-clicking the created
``vec`` or ``sca`` files.

Familiarize Yourself With OMNeT++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll need OMNeT++ knowledge to create simulations with INET. The
following pages, each about 5-10 minutes to read, are automatically
opened in the IDE when you first start it. You can also access them
later from the *Help* menu (*Help Contents -> OMNeT++ Documentation ->
Getting Started*).

-  **OMNeT++ at a Glance**: explains the purpose of various files:
   ``ini``, ``ned``, ``msg`` and so on.

-  **Getting Started with the Simulation IDE**: an illustrated guide to
   performing basic tasks in the IDE.

Then, we strongly recommend that you go through the basic tutorial that
comes with OMNeT++. It will take more than a few minutes, but it's the
quickest way to get you going.

-  **Tictoc tutorial**. It consists of steps that start from a very
   simple simulation model and progressively makes it more complex,
   introducing you to new functionality along the way.

Follow the INET Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Follow the :doc:`tutorials/index` that come with the INET Framework.

- Study the :doc:`showcases/index` that higlight how to use specific features in INET.

Modify Simulations or Create New Ones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Armed with knowledge gained from experience in the previous steps, you
should be able to modify the example simulations, or create simple new
ones.

Learn More
~~~~~~~~~~

For more in-depth knowledge, e.g. to be able to understand and modify
the components INET provides, you need to study the documentation.

-  `OMNeT++ User Manual <https://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/manual/>`_
-  :doc:`users-guide/index`
-  :doc:`developers-guide/index`
-  `Reference <https://omnetpp.org/doc/inet/api-current/neddoc/>`_

Asking for Help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you are stuck, you can ask for help on the OMNeT++ mailing list.
Doing your research before posting and being specific will greatly
increase the chance that you'll receive a useful answer.
