Step 10. Displaying transmissions and receptions
================================================

Goals
-----

In wireless network simulations, it is important to get information
about signal transmissions and receptions. By displaying transmission
and reception states, we can get a clear overview about wireless
transmissions in the network. We can see which nodes are transmitting
and which nodes are receiving signals at a given time. In this step, we
visualize nodes' transmission and reception states.

The model
---------

VoIP application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: [Config Visualization10]
   :end-before: # displaying transmissions & receptions

First, we set up communication between ``pedestrian0`` and
``pedestrian1`` to generate network traffic. In INET, VoIP communication
is implemented in two applications. :ned:`SimpleVoipSender` is a constant
bitrate source, with talkspurt support added. :ned:`SimpleVoipReceiver`
receives a VoIP stream generated by a SimpleVoipSender, and records
statistics. Details of configuring VoIP communication is out of scope in
this tutorial, you can read more in the NED documentation of
:ned:`SimpleVoipSender` and :ned:`SimpleVoipReceiver`.

Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We configure ``visualizer`` as follows.

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: # displaying transmissions & receptions
   :end-before: #---

Transmission and reception states are displayed by :ned:`MediumVisualizer`.
They can be enabled separately by setting ``displayTransmissions`` and
``displayReceptions`` to *true*. Transmission and reception state is
displayed as an icon around the node. The displacement priority of these
icons is set to a higher value because we want association icon and IP
address closer to the node.

For 3D visualization, we can use animated gif image as icon. We replace
icon of transmission and reception state by changing
``transmissionImage`` and ``receptionImage``. Image path must be the
relative path to the *inet/images* folder.

   If we start the simulation, we can see clearly, who is the transmitter, and who are the receivers.
   The signs appear, when a signal arrives or leaves the wlan NIC.
