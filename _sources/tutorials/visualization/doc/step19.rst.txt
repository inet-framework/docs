Step 19. Displaying obstacle loss
=================================

Goals
-----

Wireless signal strength is usually reduced when it encounters an
obstacle and it can lead to data loss. It is not always clear where
signal strength is reduced so visualizing that can help to facilitate
understanding working of the simulation. In this step, we enable
visualization of obstacle loss.
