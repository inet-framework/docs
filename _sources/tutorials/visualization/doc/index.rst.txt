Visualization Tutorial
======================

In this tutorial we show you, how to use the visualization module in the
INET Framework. The tutorial contains a series of simulation models,
numbered from 1 through 25. The models start from the basics and in each
step, they introduce new INET features and concepts related to
visualization module. Our goal is show the working of the visualization
module and its submodules in INET.

This is an advanced tutorial, and it assumes that you are familiar with
creating and running simulations in OMNeT++ and INET. If you aren't, you
can check out the `INET
Walkthrough <../../../doc/walkthrough/tutorial.html>`__ is an
introduction to INET and working with protocols. `INET
Showcases <https://inet.omnetpp.org/inet-showcases/>`__ are also help to
get familiar with INET modules.

If you need more information at any time, feel free to refer to the
OMNeT++ and INET documentation:

-  `OMNeT++ User
   Manual <https://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/manual/usman.html>`__
-  `OMNeT++ API
   Reference <https://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/api/index.html>`__
-  `INET Manual
   draft <https://omnetpp.org/doc/inet/api-current/inet-manual-draft.pdf>`__
-  `INET
   Reference <https://omnetpp.org/doc/inet/api-current/neddoc/index.html>`__

In the tutorial, each step is a separate configuration in the same
omnetpp.ini file. Steps build on each other, they extend the
configuration of the previous step by adding a few new lines.
