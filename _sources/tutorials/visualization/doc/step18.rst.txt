Step 18. Displaying physical objects
====================================

Goals
-----

The visualization of physical objects present in the physical
environment is essential in network simulations. Physical objects can be
a buildings, forest, etc. Physical objects have an impact on network
operation by obstructing the wireless signal. In this step, we add
physical objects to the model and visualize them.
