Step 2. Pinging after RIP convergence
=====================================

Goals
-----

In this step, RIP is used for routing in the routers. TODO: the advanced
RIP features are turned off

The model
---------

TODO: about RIP and the INET implementation

This step uses the same network as the previous one.

The configuration in ``omnetpp.ini`` is the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: Step2
   :end-before: ------


Results
-------

TODO: video

Rip convergence:

.. video:: media/step2_3.mp4
   :width: 100%

..   <!--internal video recording, normal run until sendPing, animation speed none, playback speed 2.138, max anim speed kludge in simtimetextfigure-->

Ping (basically the same as in step 1, so not sure it's needed):

.. video:: media/step2_3_ping.mp4
   :width: 100%

..   <!--internal video recording, normal run from the end of the previous video until 51s, animation speed none, playback speed 2.138, max anim speed kludge in simtimetextfigure-->

TODO: what happens
