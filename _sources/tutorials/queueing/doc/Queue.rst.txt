Enqueueing Packets
==================

.. This step demonstrates the :ned:`PacketQueue` module, which stores a configurable
   number of packets.

The :ned:`PacketQueue` module stores a configurable number of packets.

.. In the following example network, packets are produced at random intervals by an active packet
   source (:ned:`ActivePacketSource`). The packets are collected at random intervals by
   an active packet sink (:ned:`ActivePacketSink`). The source and the sink is connected
   by a FIFO queue (:ned:`PacketQueue`) where packets are stored temporarily.

In the following example network, packets are produced at random intervals by an active packet
source (:ned:`ActivePacketSource`). The packets are pushed into a FIFO queue (:ned:`PacketQueue`),
where they are stored temporarily. An active packet sink (:ned:`ActivePacketSink`) module
pops packets from the queue at random intervals.
