Active Source - Passive Sink
============================

.. V1

   In this step, packets are produced periodically by an active packet source
   (:ned:`ActivePacketSource`). The packets are consumed by a passive packet sink
   (:ned:`PassivePacketSink`).

   V2

This step demonstrates the :ned:`ActivePacketSource` and :ned:`PassivePacketSink` modules.
The active packet source has a configurable packet production interval; the passive packet
sink has a configurable consumption interval, which limits when packets can be pushed into
the module.

.. V1

   In this example network, an active packet source (:ned:`ActivePacketSource`) pushes packets
   into a passive packet sink (:ned:`PassivePacketSink`).

.. V2

In this example network, packets are produced periodically by the active packet source (:ned:`ActivePacketSource`)
and pushed into the passive packet sink (:ned:`PassivePacketSink`).
