Burst 2
=======

In this step, packets are periodically (randomly) collected by two active sinks
(:ned:`ActivePacketSinks`). One sink collects packets with a slower rate while the other
sink uses a faster rate. The two packet sinks are combined using a markov
chain with random transition matrix and random wait intervals. The packets are
provided by a single passive source (:ned:`PassivePacketSource`).
