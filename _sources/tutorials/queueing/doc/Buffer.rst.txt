Buffer
======

In this step, packets are produced periodically (randomly) by two active packet
sources (:ned:`ActivePacketSource`). The packets are collected periodically (randomly)
by two active packet sinks (:ned:`ActivePacketSink`). The sources and the sinkes are
connected by packet queues (:ned:`PacketQueue`) and packets are stored in shared packet
buffer (:ned:`PacketBuffer`). The packet buffer drops packets from the beginning of
the buffer when it gets overloaded.
