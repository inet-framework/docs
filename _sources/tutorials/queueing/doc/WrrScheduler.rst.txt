Weighted Round-Robin Scheduler
==============================

.. This step demonstrates the Weighted Round-Robin Scheduler (:ned:`WrrScheduler`) module.

The Weighted Round-Robin Scheduler (:ned:`WrrScheduler`) module connects multiple passive packet
sources to a single active packet sink. When the collector requests a packet, the scheduler pops
a packet from one of the connected packet sources.

.. In this step, packets are collected periodically by an active packet sink
   (:ned:`ActivePacketSink`). The packets are produced by two passive packet sources
   (:ned:`PassivePacketSource`). The single sink is connected to the two sources using a
   scheduler (:ned:`WrrScheduler`). The scheduler forwards packets alternately from
   one or the other source.

The :ned:`WrrScheduler` schedules packets from one of its connected packet sources in a round-robin
fashion, based on the configured weights of the inputs. For example, if the configured weights
are "2 3", then the first two packets are popped from input 0, the next three from input 1.

In this example network, packets are created by two passive packet sources (:ned:`PassivePacketSource`).
The sources are connected to a :ned:`WrrScheduler`. The scheduler is connected to an active packet
sink (:ned:`ActivePacketSink`), which pops packets from the scheduler periodically. All inputs of the
scheduler are configured to have a weight of 1, thus the scheduler pops packets alternately from one provider or the other.
