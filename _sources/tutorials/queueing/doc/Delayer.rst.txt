Packet Delayer
==============

This step demonstrates the :ned:`PacketDelayer` module, which delays packets for a configured
amount of time.

Packets are produced periodically by an active packet source
(:ned:`ActivePacketSource`). The produced packets are delayed (:ned:`PacketDelayer`) for a random
amount of time. Finally, the packets are sent into a passive packet sink (:ned:`PassivePacketSink`).
