Ordinal-Based Duplicator
========================

.. This step demonstrates the :ned:`OrdinalBasedDuplicator` module. The module duplicates packets
   based on the ordinal number of incoming packets.

The :ned:`OrdinalBasedDuplicator` module duplicates packets
based on the ordinal number of incoming packets.
The packets to be duplicated are configured by listing their ordinal numbers.

.. In this step, packets are produced periodically by an active packet source
   (:ned:`ActivePacketSource`). The packets are consumed by a passive packet sink (:ned:`PassivePacketSink`).
   Packets are passed through from the source to the sink by a duplicator (:ned:`OrdinalBasedDuplicator`).
   Every second packet is duplicated based on its ordinal number.

In this example network, packets are produced periodically by an active packet source
(:ned:`ActivePacketSource`).
The packet source pushed packets into a duplicator (:ned:`OrdinalBasedDuplicator`).
The duplicator is configured to duplicate every second packet on its ordinal number.
The packets are then consumed by a passive packet sink (:ned:`PassivePacketSink`).
