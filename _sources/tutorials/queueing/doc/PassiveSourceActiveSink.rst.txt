Passive Source - Active Sink
============================

.. V1

   In this step, packets are collected periodically by an active packet sink
   (:ned:`ActivePacketSink`). The packets are provided by a passive packet source
   (:ned:`PassivePacketSource`).

   V2

This step demonstrates the :ned:`ActivePacketSink` and :ned:`PassivePacketSource` modules.
The active packet sink module has a configurable collection interval; the passive packet
source has a configurable providing interval, which limits when packets can be popped from
the module.

.. Packets are collected periodically by the active packet sink
   and provided by the passive packet source.

The active packet sink (:ned:`ActivePacketSink`) periodically pops packets from the
passive packet source (:ned:`PassivePacketSource`).
