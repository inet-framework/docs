Requesting Protocol-Specific Behavior Based on Packet Data
==========================================================

The :ned:`ContentBasedTagger` module, similarly to :ned:`PacketTagger`, attaches protocol-specific
request tags to packets based on their content, according to the configured packet filter and packet data filter.

In this example network, an active packet source (:ned:`ActivePacketSource`) generates 1B or 2B packets
randomly.
The packet source pushes packets into the tagger (:ned:`ContentBasedTagger`), which is configured
to attach a ``HopLimitReq = 1`` tag to 1B packets. Packets are consumed by a passive packet sink
(:ned:`PassivePacketSink`).
