Weighted Round-Robin Classifier
===============================

.. This step demonstrates the Weighted Round-Robin Classifier (:ned:`WrrClassifier`).

The Weighted Round-Robin Classifier (:ned:`WrrClassifier`) module classifies packets
to its outputs in a round-robin fashion, based on the configured weights of the outputs.
For example, if the configured weights are "2 3", then first two packets are sent to output 0,
the next three to output 1.

.. In this step, packets are produced periodically by an active packet source
   (:ned:`ActivePacketSource`). The packets are consumed by two passive packet sinks
   (:ned:`PassivePacketSink`). The single source is connected to the two sinks using a
   classifier (:ned:`WrrClassifier`). The classifier forwards packets alternately to
   one or the other sink.

In this step, packets are produced periodically by an active packet source
(:ned:`ActivePacketSource`). The single source is connected to a
classifier (:ned:`WrrClassifier`), which is connected to two passive packet sinks
(:ned:`PassivePacketSink`). All outputs of the classifier are configured to have
a weight of 1, thus the classifier forwards packets alternately to
one sink or the other.
