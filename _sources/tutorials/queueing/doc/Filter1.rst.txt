Filtering an Active Source
==========================

.. This step demonstrates the :ned:`ContentBasedFilter` module, which can filter packets according
   to their contents.

The :ned:`ContentBasedFilter` module filters packets according to the configured packet filter
and packet data filter. The packets matching the filter expressions are pushed/popped on the output;
not maching packets are dropped.

.. In this step, packets are produced periodically by an active packet source
   (:ned:`ActivePacketSource`). The packets are consumed by a passive packet sink (:ned:`PassivePacketSink`).
   Packets are passed through from the source to the sink by a filter (:ned:`ContentBasedFilter`).
   Every second packet is dropped.

In this example network, an active packet source (:ned:`ActivePacketSource`) generates
either 1B or 2B packets randomly.
The source pushes packets into a filter (:ned:`ContentBasedFilter`), which
pushes 1B packets into a passive packet sink (:ned:`PassivePacketSink`), and drops 2B packets.
