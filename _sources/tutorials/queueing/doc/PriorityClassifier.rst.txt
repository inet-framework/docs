Priority Classifier
===================

.. This step demonstrates the :ned:`PriorityClassifier` module. The module pushes packets
   to the first non-full connected queue.

The :ned:`PriorityClassifier` module pushes packets to the first non-full connected queue.

.. In this step, packets are produced periodically by an active packet source
   (:ned:`ActivePacketSource`). The packets are consumed by two active packet sinks
   (:ned:`ActivePacketSink`). The sinks are connected to FIFO queues (:ned:`PacketQueue`) with
   limited capacity where packets are stored temporarily. The single source is
   connected to the two queues using a classifier (:ned:`PriorityClassifier`). The
   classifier forwards packets from the producer to the queues in a prioritized
   way, favoring the first queue.

In this step, packets are produced periodically by an active packet source
(:ned:`ActivePacketSource`). The packet source is connected to a priority classifier (:ned:`PriorityClassifier`),
which connects to two queues (:ned:`PacketQueue`). The queues are configured to have capacity
for storing one packet. The queues are connected to two active packet sinks (:ned:`ActivePacketSink`).
The classifier sends packets to the queues, favoring ``queue1``.
The packets are popped from the queues by two active packet sinks (:ned:`ActivePacketSink`).
